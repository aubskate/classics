  Yo! It's been a while. This is still a work in progress. I need to dial in the
  streaming or figure out a better hosting solution, but for now, here is a part
  of our youth. I've been tracking this stuff down over the past few years, but
  on in a text message Pat mentioned that he had a copy of Last Chance... and
  then I realized I needed a way to share this with everyone.


  If you're on your computer, you should [download the
  videos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ccgt3km20h1gz8/AAAPgjkA0fJCCFTHgL9nBPFra?dl=0)
  and save them forever. Like I mentioned above, the streaming isn't the best,
  and the download link there is full quality instead of compressed. Hope ya'll
  are still skating. Get in touch with me, my email is ryandudek at gmail.

    Peace,\
    Ryan
