  Yo! It's been a while. This is still a work in progress, but for now, here is
  a part of our youth. I've been tracking this stuff down over the past few
  years, but on in a text message Pat mentioned that he had a copy of Last
  Chance... and then I realized I needed a way to share this with everyone. If
  anyone has a video I missed, get at me.


  If you're on your computer, you should [download the
  videos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ccgt3km20h1gz8/AAAPgjkA0fJCCFTHgL9nBPFra?dl=0)
  and save them forever. You can also download each individual video by going to
  the video's page. The download links are full quality instead of compressed
  for streaming. Hope ya'll are healthy and still skating.

    Peace,\
    Ryan
